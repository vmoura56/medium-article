        How to not look stupid when you didn't understand anything
      </h1>

      <h2 class="title">The Nod</h2>
      <p>Nodding often is a great way to mimic genuine understanding.
        This is something people who actually understand things do.
        Since you're not bright enough to acquire knowledge, you can
        at least avoid that people discover the depth of your stupidity.

    <div class="paragraph">
      <h2 class="title">The Trump</h2>
      <p>A great strategy is to say what people say about you. You
        can list all the compliments that people have given you.
        What's that? Nobody has given you any compliments? That is not
        a problem. Just make them up. This way, you are not the one lying,
        it was these imaginary people that were mistaken.

      <h2 class="title">Putting it all together</h2>
      <p>The most important thing is confidence. The more you know,
        the more you realize how ignorant you really are. This will not be
        a problem for you. Since you know nothing, you don't even realize
        how ignorant you really are. Now go forth and show them
        how little you are capable of!
